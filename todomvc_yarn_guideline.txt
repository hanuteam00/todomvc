Step 1: Install Yarn
You can install Yarn using npm, which is Node.js's package manager:
npm install -g yarn

Step 2: Clone the Repository
After installing Yarn, you can clone the todomvc repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/cypress-io/todomvc.git

Step 3: Navigate to the Repository
Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
cd todomvc

Step 4: Install Dependencies
Inside the repository directory, run the following command to install all the dependencies using Yarn:
yarn install

Step 5: Build the Project
Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to create dist/bundle.js:
yarn build

Step 6: Open the Application
After building the project, you can open index.html in a browser to see the application running:
open index.html

This will open index.html in the default browser on your system.

Now you should have the todomvc application running in your browser after following these steps. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please let me know!
